                <h2>Where I would like to work</h2>
                <p>If I was to work at google, the departments I would be most interseted in are Marketing or UI and UX .</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ui and Ux would be my favourite role. I find it fascinating to see how apps utilize things such as the touch zone on a phone to improve the user experience.</li>
                    <li>Marketing interests me as I find it extremely cool to see how people are attracted to certain links or products. Marketing was my favourite class in Business at school.</li>
                    
                </ol>
                <h2>Why I think working at google suits me</h2>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>I love working in a community environment. I grew up and live in a small village however thanks to great community leaders there is a strong community spirit in the area. I am part of youth club called Foroige and we host and participate in community events.</li>
                    <li>I feel I have lots of leadership qualities. This is something I have pursued so far in my life. Through Foroige I have gone to summer camps to gain leadership skills as this will help me be of service to my community and others.</li>
                    <li>I want to be in a place that going the extra mile and helping others is appreciated just as much as completing your tasks is.</li>
                    <li>I have always been interested in the internet, google and youtube. When I was younger I filmed videos and uploaded them to my  youtube channel.</li>
