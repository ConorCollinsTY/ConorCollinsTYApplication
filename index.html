                <h2>About me</h2>
                <div classname = "intro"> <p>My name is Conor Collins. I am 15years old and I live in kildare.</p> <figure>  <img src="foroiga.png"> <figcaption> (Me at the leadership for life conference in maynooth) </figcaption></figure> </div> 
                <h2>Where I would like to work</h2>
                <p>If I was to get the chance to become an itern or employer at google, the departments I would be most interseted in are Marketing or UI and UX .</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ui and Ux would be my favourite role. I find it fascinating to see how apps utilize things such as the touch zone on a phone to improve the user experience.</li>
                    <li>Marketing interests me as I find it extremely cool to see how people are attracted to certain links or products. Marketing was one of my best and favourite subjects during Junior Cert.</li>
                    
                </ol>
                <h2>Why I think working at google suits me</h2>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>I've allways loved working in a group environment. I grew up and live in a small village where, thanks to dedicated and involved community leaders we have, there is a strong community spirit in the area. I have been part of youth club called Foroige since I was 11 and I'm constantly engaging in community work, charity events and team building ventures.</li>
                    <li>I feel I have lots of leadership qualities. I strive when apart of a team. This is something I have pursued so far in my life. Through Foroige I have gone to summer camps to gain leadership skills as this will help me be of service to my community and others.</li>
                    <li>I want to be in a place that going the extra mile and helping others is appreciated just as much as completing your tasks is.</li>
                    <li>I have always been interested in the internet, Google, and Youtube. When I was younger I even filmed videos and uploaded them to my Youtube channel.</li>
                </ul>
